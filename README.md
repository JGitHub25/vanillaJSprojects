# vanillaJSprojects

## Description
These are the projects from Brad Traversy's "20 Web Projects With Vanilla JavaScript". After completing them I have customized them to include new features (e.g. keyboard controls for the audio/video players, more options for the movie seat booking app, etc) or my preferences so the final code will be different from his. Explore the projects here:
